# animals-game
A backward-chained expert system in JESS that attempts to guess the user's animal in 20 questions or less

# About
This project was created for my Honors Advanced Topics in CS: Expert Systems class at The Harker School, taught by Dr. Nelson.

The system tries to play a game of twenty questions with the user, asking the user questions until it has found an animal consistent with the user's answers. If no animal can be found, the game ends. The question threshold is set to 20, but is a global constant and can easily be changed.

# Usage
1. Install JESS: Java Expert System Shell
2. Navigate to the correct directory and run JESS
3. Batch in the animals.clp file from within the JESS folder
4. The program will start immediately
5. To restart, enter (reset) (run)
